# Adventure-Works-Data-Engineering-Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a robust data pipeline leveraging Microsoft Azure services for efficient data ingestion, transformation, storage, and reporting. The architecture ensures scalability, reliability, and seamless data processing.

## Business Requirements
This data pipeline is designed to:
- Automate data ingestion from an HTTP source.
- Store raw data securely in a scalable data lake.
- Perform data transformation to ensure data quality and usability.
- Enable efficient querying and reporting for business insights.
- Provide an end-to-end solution for data-driven decision-making.

## Solution Overview / Architecture
The pipeline follows a structured data flow:

1. **Data Source**
   - The data originates from an HTTP source.

2. **Data Ingestion**
   - **Azure Data Factory** is used to ingest data from the source into a raw data storage layer.

3. **Raw Data Store**
   - The ingested data is stored in **Azure Data Lake Gen2** for further processing.

4. **Transformation**
   - **Databricks** is utilized to clean, transform, and structure the data.
   - The processed data is stored in a separate **Azure Data Lake Gen2** location for optimized querying and reporting.

5. **Serving Layer**
   - The transformed data is loaded into **Azure Synapse Analytics** for high-performance querying and analytics.

6. **Reporting**
   - **Power BI** is used for creating interactive dashboards and reports based on the transformed data.

## Technology Stack
- **Azure Data Factory** (Ingestion & Orchestration)
- **Azure Data Lake Gen2** (Storage)
- **Azure Databricks** (Data Transformation)
- **Azure Synapse Analytics** (Serving Layer)
- **Power BI** (Visualization & Reporting)

## Instructions / Getting Started
To replicate this pipeline, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Data Source:** Configure the HTTP source for data extraction.
2. **Ingest Data:** Use Azure Data Factory to fetch and store data in Data Lake Gen2.
3. **Transform Data:** Use Databricks notebooks to process raw data and store structured data.
4. **Load Data into Synapse:** Create tables and views for analytics.
5. **Build Reports:** Connect Power BI to Synapse and create dashboards.

## Conclusion
This project provides a scalable and efficient data pipeline using Azure services. The architecture ensures raw data is ingested, processed, stored, and analyzed seamlessly. Feel free to contribute or modify the pipeline to fit your requirements!

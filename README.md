## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a robust data pipeline leveraging Microsoft Azure services for efficient data ingestion, transformation, storage, and reporting. The architecture ensures scalability, reliability, and seamless data processing.

---

## 🎯 Business Requirements
This data pipeline is designed to:
- ✅ Automate data ingestion from an HTTP source.
- ✅ Store raw data securely in a scalable data lake.
- ✅ Perform data transformation to ensure data quality and usability.
- ✅ Enable efficient querying and reporting for business insights.
- ✅ Provide an end-to-end solution for data-driven decision-making.

---

## 🏗️ Solution Overview
The pipeline follows a structured data flow:

### 🔹 Data Source
📡 The data originates from an HTTP source.

### 🔹 Data Ingestion
📥 **Azure Data Factory** is used to ingest data from the source into a raw data storage layer.

### 🔹 Raw Data Store
📦 The ingested data is stored in **Azure Data Lake Gen2** for further processing.

### 🔹 Transformation
⚙️ **Databricks** is utilized to clean, transform, and structure the data.
- The processed data is stored in a separate **Azure Data Lake Gen2** location for optimized querying and reporting.

### 🔹 Serving Layer
🗄️ The transformed data is loaded into **Azure Synapse Analytics** for high-performance querying and analytics.

### 🔹 Reporting
📊 **Power BI** is used for creating interactive dashboards and reports based on the transformed data.
